# SQL_HR-analytics
A beginner‑friendly SQL project focused on HR analytics. This mini‑project includes a custom database, realistic sample data, and a full set of analytical SQL queries covering employee performance, attrition, department‑level insights, and more.

I created a simple SQL database to practice core concepts such as table creation, data insertion, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and analytical queries.
To make the dataset realistic, I used AI to help generate sample data and logical practice questions.

I solved most of the queries independently, and for the tricky ones, I focused on understanding the logic behind them rather than just copying answers.
This helped me strengthen my SQL fundamentals and complete this mini‑project with confidence.

This repository includes everything you need to practice the same dataset or build on top of it.

SQL Concepts Covered:

- Database & table creation

- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN

- GROUP BY, HAVING

- Aggregations (COUNT, AVG, SUM, MIN, MAX)

- HR analytics logic (attrition, performance, attendance)


How to Use This Project:
- Run schema.sql to create tables

- Run data_inserts.sql to populate data

- Try solving the questions in practice_questions.md

- Compare your answers with solutions.sql
